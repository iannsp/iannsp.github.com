Ok, If you never had used ogg file format in your music dont think you are
strange. Most people never do but this is a good format and with good format I
say Its a free format. If you never use it, ist time to try and if you use
this some time in your life and think get it out of your music library because
you can listen in iTunes wonderfull music software, you problems now are
solved. The Xiph is a group of quickTime components and it can run ogg vorbis
files into you iTunes. Be happy, and enjoy. http://www.xiph.org/
