Sorry about the english but, I only follow the other guys ;) The Rafael Dohms
from http://www.rafaeldohms.com.br elect me to write this, so, I will try and
if you don't understand somethink I wrote here, don't worry, this is more
normaly then you think.

  1. **I'm don't have degree.** I try it for 3 times and I never finished it... So I will try again this year and hope i can conclude this to never more listen some one talking about this and get a little sad.
  2. **I worked as a car mechanic for a while** and I study for. I made a course to become a car mechanics in the Senai, at Piracicaba - SP. It is real, at my signature have a reference for this.
  3. **I listen to any kind of music. except** that musics are not really music like Axe,pagode. I prefer classic music, blues, jazz, rock and some old crazys like prodigy.
  4. **I worked whith Borland Delhpi and enjoy It.** After that I got in touch with php and enjoyed a lot ;), but some times I use perl, bash script and so on...
  5. **I can drink a lot of beer without getting drunk...**but only one glass of wisky or vodka make me forgot who I am. So, if you invite me to a party... do not let me drink distilled and let me next to the stock of beer.
  6. **Read to me is a compulsion. I even read medicine leaflets.** That makes easy to select a gift for me. :)
  7. **I've already been a photographic model,** in a time that models could be ugly and I had 15 years
To get sequence of this, I need elect more seven guys, so:

  * [Ivan Rosolen](http://ivanrosolen.com) because I know he studyed lot of MVC and this year will give us a lot of presentations about it.
  * [Marcelo Toscano](www.toscano.com.br). If you like to discussion any think. That is the guy. ;)
